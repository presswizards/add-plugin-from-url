# Add Plugin From URL

Adds an option to add plugins from an external URL, and also includes a drop-down of plugins for easy selection and installation.

If this plugin saves you time, helps your clients, or helps you do better work, I’d appreciate it.

## Future Features

Ideas include:
- Adding your own plugins (name, URL) to the drop down via an options link maybe. Right now just hard-code them.
- Favoriting installed plugins from the plugin list that adds them to the drop-down
- Securely syncing the drop-down across multiple sites somehow, storing the list somewhere. Dev ideas welcome on this.
- Open to other ideas.
